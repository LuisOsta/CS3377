Learning Perl was a relatively easy process, with a few medium bumps along the way.
The main difficulties were with language-specific syntax surrounding Pearl. Specifically I had issues with the lasts() functionality in Perl,
since I couldn't get it to properly replicate the functionality of 'break' in most other languages.
I ended up changing the condition for the do while loop to account for the last() break  not working properly.
The other major difficulty was file IO, mostly with figuring out the language-specific syntax aroundw writing to the game report file.
Apart from those two, most of the process around programming the game were fairly straightforward and simple.
Mostly requiring learning the basic syntax of the language and looking up any specific things on the perl api website.
